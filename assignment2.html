<H3 ALIGN="left">Objective</H3>
This assignment instructs the students:
<UL>
<LI>How to implement well-specified algorithms.
<LI>How to build (static) function libraries from object modules.
<LI>How to call library fuctions from application programs.
<LI>How to write Makefiles.
</UL>

<H3 ALIGN="left">What is DES?</H3>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Data Encryption Standard</FONT> (DES) is a standard
encryption algorithm proposed by the US Department of Commerce. DES and
its several variants are now widely used for asymmetric encryption.
<P>
Suppose that Alice wants to send a message <I>M</I> to Bob using a
communication channel, where a third party (Carol) can intercept others'
messages. In order to make the message <I>M</I> inaccessible to Carol,
Alice transforms <I>M</I> to <I>C&nbsp;=&nbsp;E(M,K)</I> and sends the
resulting ciphertext <I>C</I> to Bob. Bob upon receiving <I>C</I>
retrieves the plaintext <I>M&nbsp;=&nbsp;D(C,K)</I>. The function
<I>E</I> is called the <I>encryption function</I> and <I>D</I> the
<I>decryption function</I>. They use a <I>key</I> <I>K</I> which
introduces the desired privacy in the scheme. Alice and Bob both know
<I>K</I> and can encrypt and decrypt, whereas Carol (or Dorothy or Emily)
without the knowledge of <I>k</I> cannot make out <I>M</I> even if
she obtains <I>C</I> by intercepting the communication channel.
<P>
There are several ways in which the (matching) functions <I>E</I> and
<I>D</I> can be designed. DES is one popular building block for encryption.
Alice first breaks up her secret message <I>M</I> into <I>blocks</I> of
64 bits and encrypts each block using the DES primitive and a secret key
<I>K</I> known to Alice and Bob only.
<P>
A complete specification of DES is available as a FIPS document at the
site:
<A HREF="http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip46-2.htm">http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip46-2.htm</A>.
There are variants of this basic DES scheme, like 2-DES, 3-DES and DESX.
In order to encrypt multiple blocks, one typically uses a feedback loop
known as <I>cipher block chaining</I> (CBC). In order to know more about
the DES variants and the CBC mode of operation, we refer the reader to
the book by Menezes, van Oorschot and Vanstone:
<A HREF="http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/">Handbook of Applied
Cryptography</A> (HAC), Chapter&nbsp;7 (Block Ciphers). We will also distribute
sample pages from books in the class.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Part 1</FONT>
<DD>Implement the encryption and decryption routines for DES, 2-DES,
3-DES.
<P><DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Part 2</FONT>
<DD>Implement the CBC modes of operation of the three DES primiives of Part 1.
<P><DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Part 3</FONT>
<DD>Encrypt English paragraphs by DES, send to your friend and let your
friend decrypt your ciphertext. Note that in this context you are your
friend's friend.
<P><DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Part 4</FONT>
<DD>Implement differential cryptanalysis for DES.
</DL>

<P><H3 ALIGN="left">How to do?</H3>
Use the following step-by-step development:
<UL>
<P><LI>Write the following pairs of header/source files:
<PRE>
DES.h      DES.c       Basic DES encryption/decryption
2DES.h     2DES.c      2-DES encryption/decryption
3DES.h     3DES.c      3-DES encryption/decryption
DESCBC.h   DESCBC.c    CBC mode of operation for (basic) DES
2DESCBC.h  2DESCBC.c   CBC mode of operation for 2-DES
3DESCBC.h  3DESCBC.c   CBC mode of operation for 3-DES
</PRE>
<P><LI>Write a <TT>Makefile</TT> that compiles the sources to generate
object modules and subsequently archives the object modules to a
static library <TT>libDES.a</TT>. In order to generate object files
from a <TT>main()</TT>-less source use <TT>gcc -c</TT> and for archiving
use <TT>ar</TT> followed by <TT>ranlib</TT>. Your <TT>Makefile</TT>
should automatically do all these things. Note that you don't have to
specify <TT>-c</TT> in a <TT>Makefile</TT>.
<P><LI>Write the text encrypt/decrypt application using the header files.
While compiling, link the static library created.
<P>
In order to encrypt
long English paragraphs break the paragraphs in blocks of eight
characters. Encode each block in 64 bits. You may exploit the ASCII
encoding of characters for this purpose. Finally use the CBC mode
for encrypting the sequence of 64 bit encoded blocks. The CBC mode
of operation requires an IV (initialization vector) that can be
generated randomly.
<P>
Your application
program should also produce 64-bit blocks of ciphertext, decrypt
each block under the CBC mode and decode each decrypted block to retrieve
the English paragraph. The matching IV should be used during decryption.
<P>
Assuming that the header files reside in <TT>/home/username/infoLab/include</TT>,
your application program should have the following <TT>#include</TT> directives:
<PRE>
#include "/home/username/infoLab/include/DES.h"
#include "/home/username/infoLab/include/2DES.h"
#include "/home/username/infoLab/include/3DES.h"
#include "/home/username/infoLab/include/DESCBC.h"
#include "/home/username/infoLab/include/2DESCBC.h"
#include "/home/username/infoLab/include/3DESCBC.h"
</PRE>
Also suppose that your static library (<TT>libDES.a</TT>) resides in the
directory <TT>/home/username/infoLab/lib</TT>. Linking during compilation
can be effected by:
<PRE>
gcc myApplication.c -L/home/username/infoLab/lib -lDES
</PRE>
<TT>#include</TT> and the <TT>-L</TT> option also accept relative path names.

<P><LI>Write the differential cryptanalysis routine.
